# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [X] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
  My app meets the 4 steps in CLI. In cli.rb, my app greets the user, asks the user for input about which hero the user wants info about, stores the input, and then executes the request by displaying hero about the hero.
- [X] Pull data from an external source
  In superhero.rb, my app scraps data from https://www.thoughtco.com/top-marvel-comic-book-superheroes-804277.
- [X] Implement both list and detail views
  My app displays an initial list of heroes from first data scrape.  Then, my app does the second data scrap retrieving a bio on the selected hero by the user.
